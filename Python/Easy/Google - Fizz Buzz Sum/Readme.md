Write a function fizz_buzz_sum to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a target value.

For example, if the target value was 10, the multiples of 3 or 5 below 10 are 3, 5, 6, and 9.

Because 
3
+
5
+
6
+
9
=
23
3+5+6+9=23, our function would return 23.


Python Code:
def fizz_buzz_sum(target):
  sum = 0
  for i in range(target):
    if (i % 3 == 0) or (i % 5 == 0):
      sum += i
  return sum
