Assume there are three Spotify tables: artists, songs, and global_song_rank, which contain information about the artists, songs, and music charts, respectively.

Write a query to find the top 5 artists whose songs appear most frequently in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table. Display the top 5 artist names in ascending order, along with their song appearance ranking.

If two or more artists have the same number of song appearances, they should be assigned the same ranking, and the rank numbers should be continuous (i.e. 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5). If you've never seen a rank order like this before, do the rank window function tutorial.

artists Table:
Column Name	Type
artist_id	integer
artist_name	varchar
label_owner	varchar
artists Example Input:
artist_id	artist_name	label_owner
101	Ed Sheeran	Warner Music Group
120	Drake	Warner Music Group
125	Bad Bunny	Rimas Entertainment
songs Table:
Column Name	Type
song_id	integer
artist_id	integer
name	varchar
songs Example Input:
song_id	artist_id	name
55511	101	Perfect
45202	101	Shape of You
22222	120	One Dance
19960	120	Hotline Bling
global_song_rank Table:
Column Name	Type
day	integer (1-52)
song_id	integer
rank	integer (1-1,000,000)
global_song_rank Example Input:
day	song_id	rank
1	45202	5
3	45202	2
1	19960	3
9	19960	15
Example Output:
artist_name	artist_rank
Ed Sheeran	1
Drake	2
Explanation:
Ed Sheeran's song appeared twice in the Top 10 list of global song rank while Drake's song is only listed once. Therefore, Ed is ranked #1 and Drake is ranked #2.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


```sql

  artist_name,
  rn as artist_rank

  on a.artist_id = s.artist_id

where
